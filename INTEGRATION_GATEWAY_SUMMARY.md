## 🚀 Unified Integration Gateway

The main Integration Gateway orchestrates both components to provide:

### Enterprise Full Integration
```javascript
// Example: Tech startup deployment
const techSetup = await gateway.deployTechStartup('InnovateTech Solutions', 'mcp.innovatetech.com');
// Result: Complete MCP + Zapier integration in 4.5 hours, $500 setup cost
```

### Professional Individual Setup
```javascript
// Example: Data scientist professional
const professionalSetup = await gateway.deployIndividualProfessional(
  'Dr. Sarah Johnson', 'data-science', 'data-scientist'
);
// Result: Personal MCP server with career intelligence in 20 minutes
```
