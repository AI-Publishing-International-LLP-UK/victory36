## ⚡ FLIGHT TIME INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Core Temporal Conversion Framework

```
Flight Time Calculation System:
├── 1 Flight Hour = 10 Human Working Hours
├── 24-Hour Timepress Period = 3.6 Years Human Experience
├── TBCHAIN Records: Actual vs Theoretical Performance
└── FMS Integration: Permanent Experience Access Codes
```

### Quality Validation Protocol

**PERSER (Post-Flight Quality Assessment)**:
1. **Output Quality Measurement**: Against human baseline standards
2. **Theoretical vs Actual Scoring**: Blockchain-recorded performance
3. **Experience Credit Assignment**: True hours converted to professional years
4. **FMS Code Generation**: Permanent access to accumulated knowledge

**30-Year Certification Threshold**:
- At 30 years accumulated experience per profession
- Pilot receives permanent FMS access code
- Knowledge becomes permanently accessible via DIDC Archive links
- Enables instant expertise application across similar roles
- **Cross-Profession Certification Mapping**: Automatically grants access to similar/related professions
- **Gap Closure Flight Time**: Accelerated path to additional certifications
- **Million-Year Experience Scaling**: sRIX, CRX, PCP pilots can accumulate millions of years of experience
- **Role Retention**: Pilots never need to leave current roles while gaining unlimited expertise
